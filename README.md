# STM32 LoRa APRS Repeater (Bluepill + 2x RFM96W)

## 📡 Project Overview

A simple, energy-efficient **LoRa APRS Repeater** based on the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (Bluepill) and two RFM96W radio modules (SX1278). The device operates in "Cross-Band" mode (receives on one frequency, transmits on another) and features telemetry and watchdog functions.

## 🚀 Features and Capabilities

* **Dual Radio:** Independent modules for RX (receiving from tracker) and TX (transmitting to iGate).
* **Continuous Listening (RX Continuous):** Ensures no frames are missed.
* **Buffering (Queue):** FIFO queue for 5 packets – prevents data loss when multiple frames arrive simultaneously.
* **Transparency:** Forwards raw LoRa frames (including 3C FF 01 headers), ensuring compatibility with most trackers and iGates.
* **Intelligent Watchdog (IWDG):** Automatic reset system in case of CPU hang-up.
* **Radio Sanity Check:** Custom mechanism for monitoring the status of radio modules. If a transmitter hang-up is detected (e.g., due to SPI errors or Brown-out), the system automatically performs a hard reset of the RF module.
* **Reset Counter (R_CNT):** Statistics for resets (Watchdog/Radio) stored in Backup registers (BKP); these persist through device resets and only clear upon a total power loss.
* **Energy Efficiency:** The processor enters SLEEP mode (WFI) when idle.
* **Telemetry:** Automatic station status transmission every 1 hour (supply voltage, coordinates, and reset counter).
* **Debug Mode:** Real-time monitoring of received and transmitted frames via UART when the service jumper is shorted.

## ⚙️ Radio Parameters (LoRa)

## 📡 Telemetry

The repeater identifies itself with the callsign: `NOCALL-1` (default).
Default coordinates (Null Island/Test): `!0100.00N/00100.00E`.
Telemetry frame format (sent every 1 hour):
```text
!0100.00N/00100.00E#NOCALL-1 BAT:3.42V R_CNT:0
```
* **Coordinates:** 51.737N, 19.574E (encoded in NMEA format).
* **Voltage:** Internal reference voltage (VREFINT) reading converted to supply voltage (VDDA).
* **R_CNT:** Reset counter from Backup Domain (BKP_DR1).

## 🛠️ Debugging

To view device operation:
* Connect a USB-UART converter to pins PA9 (RX converter) and GND.
* Short pin PB12 to ground (GND).
* Open a terminal (e.g., PuTTY, RealTerm) with a baud rate of 115200 bps.

Example logs:
```text
SYS: Booting...
SYS: RX Init OK
SYS: TX Init OK
RX: Recv 89 bytes
RX CONTENT (TXT): <▒NOCALL-10>APLRG1...
QUEUE: Added packet (89 B)
TX: Preparing to send...
APRS CONTENT: <▒NOCALL-10>APLRG1...
TX: Done.
```
If pin PB12 is open (High state - PullUp), the repeater operates "silently" on UART, saving processor time.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **Antennas:** Never power up the TX module without an antenna connected! This risks damaging the RFM96 chip.
* **Power Supply:** Ensure the 3.3V source has sufficient current capability (LoRa transmission can draw >100mA).
* **Separation:** Due to the close frequencies (100kHz spacing), physical separation of RX and TX antennas is recommended to prevent the transmitter from desensitizing the receiver, or use bandpass filters/duplexer.
